title: Move a Jira issue to another project
number: 5
status: rejected
---

## Context

I need to move issues from one project to another.

## Decision

Unfortunately, that is impossible: [not with automation](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/move-an-issue-with-automation/) and [not from API](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Is-it-possible-to-programatically-move-issue-to-another-project/qaq-p/936099).

## Consequences

Suffering :)
