title: Convert a Jira task to a subtask
number: 6
status: rejected
---

## Context

I need to convert a task (or a story) to a subtask.

## Decision

Unfortunately, that is impossible: [not with REST API at least](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Can-I-change-the-parent-field-of-sub-task-in-Jira-via-REST-API/qaq-p/750954) and [not using Automation](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Core-Server-questions/Jira-automation-convert-a-task-to-a-sub-task-and-link-it-to-a/qaq-p/1294818).

## Consequences

Suffering :(
